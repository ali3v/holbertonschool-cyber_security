# Linux Security Basics

System hardening and security monitoring on Linux. Practical exercises covering login tracking, network analysis, firewall configuration, and system auditing.

## Tasks Overview

**0-login.sh** - Login session monitoring  
Tracking user login history and active sessions. Essential for detecting unauthorized access.

**1-active-connections.sh** - Network connection analysis  
Identifying active network connections and their states.

**2-incoming_connections.sh** - Monitoring inbound traffic  
Analyzing incoming connections to detect suspicious activity.

**3-firewall_rules.sh** - Firewall configuration  
Working with iptables to control network traffic and enforce security policies.

**4-network_services.sh** - Service enumeration  
Identifying running network services and their exposure.

**5-audit_system.sh** - System auditing  
Reviewing system logs and security events for anomalies.

**6-capture_analyze.sh** - Packet capture and analysis  
Using tcpdump to capture network traffic for investigation.

**7-scan.sh** - Security scanning  
Performing security scans to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## Concepts Covered

- User authentication and session management
- Network traffic monitoring and analysis
- Firewall rules and packet filtering (iptables)
- Service hardening and exposure reduction
- Log analysis and system auditing
- Packet capture with tcpdump
- Vulnerability scanning techniques

## Skills Applied

Bash scripting, Linux system administration, network security fundamentals, defensive security practices. Understanding both how to secure systems and how attackers might try to compromise them.

## Security Focus

These exercises emphasize the defensive side - monitoring, detection, and hardening. Knowing how to secure a Linux system is crucial for:
- Server administration
- Understanding attack surface
- Detecting intrusions
- Building resilient infrastructure

The same skills apply when pentesting - you need to know what defenders are looking for to avoid detection.
