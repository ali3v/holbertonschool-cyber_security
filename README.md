# Cybersecurity Coursework - Holberton School

This repository contains my practical work and exercises from Holberton School's cybersecurity program. Organized by topic, covering everything from basic security concepts to advanced offensive techniques.

## About

Working through a structured security curriculum focused on hands-on skills. The approach here is learning by doing - breaking things, analyzing vulnerabilities, writing exploits, and understanding defensive measures from an attacker's perspective.

## Structure

### Cybersecurity Basics
Foundation concepts and tools:
- Security principles and threat modeling
- Cryptography fundamentals (hashing, encryption)
- Password security and key generation
- Basic system analysis

### Linux Security  
System hardening and defensive techniques:
- Login monitoring and access control
- Network connection analysis
- Firewall configuration (iptables)
- System auditing and log analysis
- Network traffic capture with tcpdump
- Security scanning and reconnaissance

### Network Security
Active and passive reconnaissance:
- Information gathering techniques
- Port scanning and service enumeration
- Network mapping and topology discovery
- Traffic analysis and packet inspection
- DNS and WHOIS reconnaissance

### Web Application Security
Offensive web testing:
- SQL injection (manual and automated)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Authentication bypass techniques
- Session hijacking and management flaws
- NoSQL injection
- Burp Suite workflows and methodology
- Custom exploit development

## Tools & Technologies

**Primary Environment:** Kali Linux

**Languages:** Python, Bash, PHP, SQL

**Tools Used:**
- Burp Suite Professional
- SQLmap, NoSQLmap
- Nmap, Masscan
- Wireshark, tcpdump
- John the Ripper
- enum4linux
- Various custom scripts

## Approach

Each directory contains practical exercises with solutions. The focus is on understanding the vulnerability, exploiting it, and documenting the process. Most tasks involve:

1. Reconnaissance and enumeration
2. Vulnerability identification  
3. Exploitation (manual + automated)
4. Documentation and write-ups

Some solutions include custom scripts when existing tools weren't sufficient or when automation made sense.

## Notes

This is coursework - structured learning with specific objectives. Real-world security work involves more complexity, but these fundamentals are solid foundation for practical pentesting.

The commit history shows progression through topics. Started with basic concepts, gradually moving into more advanced offensive techniques.

## Usage

Feel free to browse the exercises and solutions. Code is meant to be educational - use responsibly and only in authorized testing environments.

Each subdirectory has its own README with specific task descriptions and requirements.
