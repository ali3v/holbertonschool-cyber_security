# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Basic security concepts and fundamental tools. Getting familiar with core principles - hashing, encryption, password generation, and system analysis.

## Tasks

**0-release.sh** - System information gathering  
Finding OS release details, basic recon on the environment.

**1-gen_password.sh** - Secure password generation  
Creating strong random passwords using system utilities.

**2-sha256_validator.sh** - Hash verification  
Validating file integrity with SHA256 checksums.

**3-gen_key.sh** - Cryptographic key generation  
Generating secure encryption keys for various use cases.

**4-root_process.sh** - Process analysis  
Identifying and analyzing processes running with elevated privileges.

## Concepts Covered

- Operating system fingerprinting
- Cryptographic hashing (SHA256)
- Password security best practices  
- Key generation techniques
- Privilege analysis on Linux systems

## Skills Applied

Bash scripting, system utilities, basic crypto operations, process monitoring. Foundation stuff but important to understand before moving into exploitation.

These exercises focused on defensive concepts first - understanding how security mechanisms work before learning to break them.
