# OWASP Top 10

Exploring the most critical web application security risks according to OWASP. Practical exercises covering real-world vulnerabilities.

## Challenges

**0-flag.txt** - OWASP vulnerability exploitation  
Successfully identified and exploited a Top 10 vulnerability.

**1-xor_decoder.sh** - Cryptographic analysis  
Breaking weak encryption/encoding schemes. XOR cipher analysis and decoding.

## OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

Covered various categories including:
- Injection flaws (SQL, NoSQL, command injection)
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure
- XML external entities (XXE)
- Broken access control
- Security misconfiguration
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Insecure deserialization
- Using components with known vulnerabilities
- Insufficient logging & monitoring

## Skills Developed

- Identifying OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web apps
- Understanding cryptographic weaknesses (XOR)
- Exploiting authentication and authorization flaws
- Practical application of security frameworks

## Real-World Relevance

OWASP Top 10 represents actual vulnerabilities found in production applications. Organizations use this as a baseline for secure development practices.

Understanding these risks is crucial for:
- Penetration testing
- Secure code review
- Risk assessment
- Building secure applications

The XOR decoder exercise demonstrates why weak crypto is dangerous - simple ciphers can be broken with basic scripting.
