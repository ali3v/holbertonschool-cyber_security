# Burp Suite Fundamentals

Learning professional web application testing with Burp Suite Professional. Covers core features, workflows, and practical exploitation techniques used in real penetration tests.

## Challenges Completed

Successfully solved 7 different scenarios (0-flag.txt through 6-flag.txt), each focusing on different Burp Suite capabilities:

- HTTP request interception and modification
- Response manipulation
- Parameter fuzzing and injection testing
- Session token analysis
- Authentication bypass techniques
- Automated scanning vs manual testing
- Advanced Repeater and Intruder usage

## Burp Suite Features Practiced

**Proxy & Intercept:**
- Capturing and modifying requests in real-time
- Analyzing application behavior
- Testing different payloads manually

**Repeater:**
- Iterative testing of specific requests
- Fine-tuning exploitation payloads
- Observing application responses to modified inputs

**Intruder:**
- Automated fuzzing and brute force attacks
- Payload positioning and encoding
- Analyzing attack results for vulnerabilities

**Scanner (where applicable):**
- Automated vulnerability detection
- Understanding scan results
- Manual verification of findings

## Methodology

The exercises emphasized professional pentesting workflow:
1. Map application functionality (crawl/discover)
2. Intercept and analyze traffic patterns
3. Identify potential injection points
4. Test systematically with Repeater
5. Automate repetitive tests with Intruder
6. Exploit vulnerabilities manually for proof

## Skills Developed

- Efficient HTTP traffic analysis
- Request/response manipulation
- Identifying common web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, auth bypass)
- Using Burp for both passive and active testing
- Understanding web app logic through traffic inspection

## Real-World Usage

Burp Suite is industry standard for web app pentesting. These fundamentals apply to:
- Professional penetration testing engagements
- Bug bounty hunting on platforms like HackerOne/Bugcrowd
- Security assessments and code review
- Personal research and CTF competitions

The tool is powerful but methodology matters more - understanding what to look for and how to exploit it systematically.

## Notes

All testing performed in controlled lab environments. Burp Suite Professional license used for advanced features. The goal wasn't just capturing flags but understanding the underlying vulnerabilities and how they're exploited in practice.
